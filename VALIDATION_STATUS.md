## Next Stage: Citation Audits

### → Stage 5: Run Citation Audits
**Status**: READY TO BEGIN
**Next Step**: Run systematic citation audits on all 24 papers

**Two Implementation Options**:

#### Option A: Manual Audit (Recommended for Initial Validation)
**Platform**: Claude (Projects mode) or ChatGPT (with web search)

**Process**:
1. Select one audit input file from `audit_inputs/`
2. Copy the entire content
3. Paste into Claude/ChatGPT with agentic mode enabled
4. AI agent will:
   - Search Semantic Scholar for each reference
   - Verify titles, authors, years, venues
   - Retrieve abstracts and summaries
   - Check SCImago Journal Rank (SJR) for quality metrics
   - Generate comprehensive audit report
5. Save generated `*_ReferenceAudit.md` file to `audit_reports/`
6. Repeat for all 24 papers

**Time Estimate**:
- Per paper: ~10-15 minutes (based on empirical testing)
- Total for 24 papers: ~4-6 hours of active time
- Can be done in batches over several sessions

**Advantages**:
- Full control over audit process
- Can observe AI agent behavior and verification strategies
- Easier to validate accuracy of individual audits
- Better for methodology documentation

#### Option B: Batch Processing (Programmatic API)
**Platform**: API access to Claude/ChatGPT with tool use

**Process**:
1. Load `audit_inputs/audit_batch_manifest.json`
2. Iterate through each paper's input file
3. Submit to AI agent API with tool access (Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar, CrossRef)
4. Collect generated audit reports automatically
5. Save all reports to `audit_reports/` directory

**Requirements**:
- API access with tool use enabled
- Implementation of batch processing script
- Error handling and retry logic
- Progress tracking and logging

**Advantages**:
- Faster processing (can run unattended)
- Consistent methodology across all papers
- Easier to scale to larger datasets
- Better for reproducibility

**Current Recommendation**: Start with **Option A (Manual)** for first 5-10 papers to:
- Validate methodology
- Document AI agent behavior
- Test accuracy and reliability
- Identify edge cases and failure modes
- Then switch to Option B for remaining papers if validated

## Pending Stages

### Stage 6: Generate Aggregate Statistics
**Script**: `analysis/statistics.py`
**Status**: READY (waiting for audit reports)

**Process**:
1. Load all audit reports from `audit_reports/` directory
2. Extract metrics from each report:
   - Verification success rate
   - Orphan references count
   - Orphan citations count

   - Quality distribution (Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 journals)
3. Calculate aggregate statistics:
   - Total references processed
   - Average verification rate
   - Average orphan rate
   - Quality metrics across all papers
4. Generate summary report: `aggregate_statistics.md`
5. Export JSON data: `aggregate_statistics.json`

**Expected Metrics to Track**:
- Verification success rate: % of references successfully verified
- Issue detection rate: % of papers with critical issues
- Fabricated reference detection: Count of suspected fabrications
- Quality distribution: Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 journal breakdown
- Time efficiency: Average audit time per paper

### Stage 7: Create Validation Report

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive validation report for Agents4Science 2025 paper

**Report Contents**:
1. **Methodology Validation**
   - Accuracy of AI-powered verification
   - Comparison to manual verification (sample)
   - False positive/negative rates
   - Edge cases and failure modes

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Time efficiency gains vs. manual review
   - Verification success rates across paper types
   - Quality assessment accuracy
   - Scalability analysis

3. **Statistical Significance**
   - Sample size justification (24 papers, 1,212 references)
   - Confidence intervals for key metrics
   - Reliability and consistency analysis
   - Comparison to baseline (traditional review)

4. **Critical Analysis**
   - Limitations of AI-powered auditing
   - Cases requiring human oversight
   - Abstract-only verification constraints
   - Context window limitations

5. **Practical Guidelines**
   - When to use AI auditing
   - When to require human review
   - Integration into academic workflows
   - Training and implementation recommendations

**Output**:
- Validation report: `VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
- Supporting data: `validation_data.json`
- Figures and visualizations for paper

## Quality Control Notes

### PDF Extraction Quality
**Issue Observed**: Some PDFs (e.g., Wang et al. systematic review) have word spacing issues where spaces are removed between words during extraction.

**Example**: "MITRECorporation" instead of "MITRE Corporation"

**Impact**: References are still identifiable and can be verified, but may require fuzzy matching in some cases.

**Mitigation**: The audit protocol instructs AI agents to use semantic matching rather than exact string matching, which handles these artifacts.

### Reference Formatting Variability
**Observation**: Different papers use different citation styles:
- Numbered format: `1. Author et al...`
- Bracketed format: `[1] Author et al...`
- Author-year format: `Author (Year)...`

**Handling**: The extraction script successfully parsed all formats using cascading fallback strategies.

### Large Reference Lists
**Challenge**: One paper (Wang et al.) has 133 references, which may test AI agent context window limits.

**Strategy**: Monitor audit performance on this paper specifically. If context window issues occur, implement batching strategy for large reference lists.

---

## Reproducibility Notes

### Environment
- **Python Version**: 3.12
- **Key Libraries**: pdfplumber, requests, json, pathlib
- **Platform**: Windows (but code is cross-platform compatible)

### Seed Randomness

- Extracted references: Included in repository
- Audit inputs: Included in repository

### Code Availability
All scripts are in the `analysis/` directory with comprehensive documentation.

## Research Questions for Validation

The citation audits will help answer:

1. **Accuracy**: How accurately can AI agents verify academic references?
2. **Reliability**: What is the consistency of verification across different papers and disciplines?
3. **Detection**: Can AI agents identify fabricated references, misrepresentations, and citation errors?
4. **Efficiency**: How much time is saved compared to manual verification?
5. **Quality**: How accurate is automated journal quality assessment (SJR lookup)?
6. **Limitations**: What types of references are most difficult to verify?
7. **Scalability**: Does performance degrade with larger reference lists?

---

## Next Actions Required

1. **Create audit reports directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir audit_reports
   ```

2. **Choose audit implementation**: Manual (Option A) or Batch (Option B)

3. **Begin audits**: Start with smallest paper (16 references) as test case

4. **Validate first audit**: Manually verify accuracy of first audit report

5. **Continue systematically**: Process all 24 papers

6. **Run statistics**: Execute `statistics.py` on completed audits

7. **Generate validation report**: Create comprehensive analysis for conference paper
