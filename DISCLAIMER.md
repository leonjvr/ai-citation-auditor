# DISCLAIMER

## Research Methodology Validation - Not Author Evaluation

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: This repository contains validation data and audit reports generated as part of a research study on AI-powered citation auditing methodology. The audit reports **DO NOT** represent evaluations of the authors or quality assessments of the original research papers.

### Purpose of This Research

This project validates an **AI-powered citation auditing methodology** for academic research. The audit reports were generated:

1. **To test the AI methodology's capabilities** - not to evaluate specific papers
2. **As validation dataset examples** - demonstrating the audit tool's performance
3. **For statistical analysis purposes** - measuring accuracy, efficiency, and detection rates

### Important Limitations and Caveats

⚠️ **NOT A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW**: Only a **sample of references** from each paper was manually verified by the researchers. The audit reports were primarily generated by AI agents and should not be considered authoritative evaluations.

⚠️ **METHODOLOGY DEMONSTRATION**: The audits demonstrate what the AI tool *can detect*, not definitive assessments of citation quality.

⚠️ **NO CLAIMS ABOUT SPECIFIC PAPERS**: We make **no claims** about the quality, validity, or integrity of any specific research paper included in this validation dataset.

⚠️ **POSSIBLE ERRORS**: The AI-powered audits may contain:
- False positives (flagging legitimate references as problematic)
- False negatives (missing actual issues)
- Verification errors due to database limitations
- Misinterpretations of citation context

⚠️ **SAMPLE-BASED VALIDATION**: Researchers manually verified only a **representative sample** of audit results to assess methodology performance. Not all 1,212 references were independently verified by humans.

### No Liability for Audit Results

The researchers, affiliated institutions, and AI-Powered Citation Auditor project:

- **DO NOT** warrant the accuracy of individual audit reports
- **DO NOT** make claims about specific papers' citation quality
- **DO NOT** intend these audits as evaluations of authors' work
- **DO NOT** accept liability for decisions made based on these audit reports

### Ethical Use of This Data

If you are an author of one of the papers included in this validation dataset:

1. **This is not a formal peer review** - The audit report does not represent an official evaluation
2. **Verification recommended** - Any issues flagged should be independently verified
3. **Methodology demonstration** - Your paper was selected as a representative example, not targeted for criticism
4. **Contact us** - If you have concerns about how your work is represented, please contact the researchers
