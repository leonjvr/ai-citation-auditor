## ⚠️ Important: Author Name Convention

**Author**: LJ Janse van Rensburg

**CRITICAL NAMING CONVENTION:**
- **Surname**: "Janse van Rensburg" (complete surname - not "Rensburg" or "van Rensburg")
- **Given names/Initials**: "LJ" or "L. J."
- **CORRECT citations**:
  - `Janse van Rensburg, L. J.` (APA, with periods)
  - `Janse van Rensburg, LJ` (without periods)
  - `LJ Janse van Rensburg` (natural order)
- **INCORRECT citations** (DO NOT USE):
  - ❌ "Rensburg, LJ"
  - ❌ "van Rensburg, LJ"
  - ❌ "LJ van Rensburg"

**For American/International authors**: "Janse van Rensburg" is a compound surname common in South African Afrikaans naming traditions, similar to compound surnames in Spanish (e.g., "García López") or Dutch (e.g., "van der Berg"). The entire phrase "Janse van Rensburg" functions as a single surname unit.

**Alphabetization**: File under "J" (for "Janse van Rensburg"), not "R" or "V".

## Citation in Different Contexts

### In Methods Section

**Example 1: Full methodology replication**

> "We conducted reference audits using the AI-Powered Citation Auditor protocol
> (Author, 2025), a zero-assumption methodology for systematic citation verification.
> The protocol employs Agentic AI (Claude Sonnet 4.5) with access to academic search
> tools including Semantic Scholar and Google Scholar. Complete replication
> instructions are available at https://github.com/[username]/ai-citation-auditor"

**Example 2: Partial adaptation**

> "Our citation verification procedure was adapted from the AI-Powered Citation
> Auditor methodology (Author, 2025), modified to include discipline-specific
> databases for [field]. The core zero-assumption principle—requiring explicit
> documentation of verification failures—was maintained throughout."

**Example 3: Comparative study**

> "To evaluate AI-powered citation auditing, we compared the AI-Powered Citation
> Auditor (Author, 2025) against traditional manual verification across a corpus
> of [N] academic documents. The AI methodology achieved [X]% accuracy compared
> to human expert review."

### In Results Section

**Example citing findings:**

> "Consistent with the empirical results reported by Author (2025), our audit
> identified [Y]% orphan references across [Z] student dissertations, suggesting
> widespread issues with reference list management in [context]."

### In Discussion Section

**Example citing limitations:**

> "As noted in the AI-Powered Citation Auditor methodology (Author, 2025), abstract-only
> verification cannot detect nuanced content misrepresentations, requiring human expert
> review for critical references."
