## Methodology Notes

### Verification Approach
- **Primary sources**: Semantic Scholar API, Google Scholar, CrossRef
- **Secondary sources**: PubMed, ScienceDirect, publisher websites
- **Tertiary sources**: CNKI references, academic citation databases
- **Quality databases**: SCImago Journal Rank, Journal Citation Reports

### Limitations
1. **Chinese journal accessibility**: Many Chinese journals not fully indexed in English databases
2. **Paywall restrictions**: Some full-text verification limited to abstracts
3. **Grey literature**: Theses and books harder to verify than journal articles
4. **Language barriers**: Some sources may exist only in Chinese databases

### Confidence Levels
- **HIGH**: Direct verification through DOI, PMID, or publisher website
- **MEDIUM**: Verification through citations and related works
- **LOW**: Limited evidence; related research found but exact match unclear
- **FAILED**: No evidence found in any database
