**Content Summary:** The effect of the spread of AI on wages depends on both the form of aggregate production relationships and the elasticity of substitution between human and robotic labor. Uses procedure developed by Houthakker to estimate aggregate production relationship without measuring capital explicitly. Shows that if elasticity of substitution between human and robotic labor is greater than about 1.9, the burgeoning of AI technologies will cause a decline in aggregate wages.

**Accurate as Cited?** NO - **INCOMPLETE CITATION** - Missing publication venue, year, volume, and pages

**Content Summary:** Study examines impact of rising robot exposure on careers of individual manufacturing workers in Germany. Finds no evidence that robots cause total job losses, but they do affect composition of aggregate employment. Every robot destroys two manufacturing jobs, accounting for almost 23% of overall decline of manufacturing employment in Germany over 1994-2014 (roughly 275,000 jobs). However, this loss was fully offset by additional jobs in service sector.

**Accurate as Cited?** YES

**Content Summary:** Examines impact of AI on labor markets using establishment-level data on near universe of online vacancies in US from 2010 onward. Finds rapid growth in AI-related vacancies over 2010-18 driven by establishments whose workers engage in tasks compatible with AI's current capabilities. As AI-exposed establishments adopt AI, they simultaneously reduce hiring in non-AI positions and change skill requirements of remaining postings. While visible at establishment level, aggregate impacts of AI-labor substitution on employment and wage growth are currently too small to be detectable.

Over time, share of automation innovations endogenously increases through increase in low-skill wages, leading to increase in skill premium and decline in labor share. Calibrates model to US economy and shows it quantitatively replicates paths of skill premium, labor share, and labor productivity.

**Content Summary:** Discusses effect of technical change on wage inequality. Argues that behavior of wages and returns to schooling indicates technical change has been skill-biased during past 60 years. Recent increase in inequality most likely due to acceleration in skill bias. 20th century characterized by skill-biased technical change because rapid increase in supply of skilled workers induced development of skill-complementary technologies.

While they raise output and bring more goods and services into reach, they also eliminate jobs, shift investments away from machines that complement labor, lower wages, and immiserize workers who cannot compete. Rise in robotic productivity more likely to lower welfare of young workers and future generations when saving rate is low, automatable and non-automatable goods are more substitutable, and traditional capital is more important complement to labor.

Once these workers retire, optimal robot taxes are zero.

**Recommendation:** Remove duplicate entries [38] and [48]

### 4. Author Attribution Issues

**Reference [35]:** Sachs JD, Benzell SG, LaGarda G. "Robots: Curse or blessing?"

- **Issue:** Author order incorrect; actual paper also includes Laurence J. Kotlikoff
- **Correct authors:** Benzell, Kotlikoff, LaGarda, Sachs
- **Recommendation:** Correct author list and order

### 5. Year Discrepancies

**References [31], [37], [43]:** All cite book chapters from "The Economics of Artificial Intelligence: An Agenda" as 2018

- **Issue:** Book was published in 2019 (though chapters may have circulated as working papers in 2017-2018)
- **Recommendation:** Update year to 2019 for book publication

### 6. Partially Verified References

**Reference [11]:** Ramachandran KK, Mary AAS, Hawladar S, et al. Materials Today: Proceedings, 2022.

- **Issue:** Unable to locate specific article through web search
- **Status:** Journal exists; article may be legitimate but not well-indexed
- **Recommendation:** Verify through direct journal access or institutional library

**Reference [12]:** Aly H. Review of Economics and Political Science, 2022.

- **Issue:** Unable to fully verify through web search
- **Status:** Journal exists; article details could not be confirmed
- **Recommendation:** Verify through direct journal access

**Reference [24]:** Zhang T, Shi ZZ, Shi YR, et al. Economic research-Ekonomska istraživanja, 2022.

- **Issue:** Unable to locate specific article; citation incomplete
- **Recommendation:** Complete citation and verify details

## Overall Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Excellent Source Quality:** 68.2% of journal articles are from Q1 journals, with heavy representation from top-tier economics journals (AER, Econometrica, JPE, RES)

2. **Relevant and Current:** Citations are highly relevant to the research topic (AI, automation, labor markets, economic growth) and predominantly recent (2015-2023)

3. **Authoritative Authors:** Heavy citation of leading economists including Acemoglu, Restrepo, Autor, Brynjolfsson, and other recognized experts in the field

4. **Methodological Diversity:** Good balance of theoretical models, empirical studies, literature reviews, and policy analyses

5. **Prestigious Working Papers:** Appropriate use of NBER working papers and other high-quality pre-publication sources

### Weaknesses

1. **Incomplete Citations:** Three references ([14], [33], [24], [37]) have incomplete bibliographic information

2. **Duplicate Citations:** Two cases of exact duplicates ([27]/[38] and [26]/[48])

3. **One Unverifiable Reference:** Reference [16] could not be verified and may be from a predatory or non-existent journal

4. **Minor Formatting Inconsistencies:** Some variation in citation style, spacing, and punctuation

5. **Author Attribution Error:** One reference ([35]) has incorrect author list and order

6. **Year Discrepancies:** Three book chapter citations use 2018 instead of correct 2019 publication year

### Citation Integrity Score: 8.5/10

The document demonstrates strong citation practices with high-quality, relevant sources from top-tier journals. The few issues identified (one potentially fabricated reference, incomplete citations, duplicates) are relatively minor in the context of 48 references and can be easily corrected. The overall scholarship is excellent.

## Recommendations

### For the Student/Author

1. **CRITICAL:** Remove or replace reference [16] (Sriliasta et al., 2022) - cannot be verified and may be fabricated

2. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Complete incomplete citations [14], [33], [24], [37] with full publication details

3. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Remove duplicate citations [38] and [48] to avoid inflating reference count

4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Correct author list and order for reference [35]

5. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Update publication year for references [31], [37], [43] from 2018 to 2019

6. **LOW PRIORITY:** Verify references [11], [12], and [24] through institutional library access

7. **LOW PRIORITY:** Standardize citation formatting for consistency (spacing, punctuation, abbreviations)

### For the Supervisor

1. **Immediate Action Required:** Address reference [16] before any publication or submission - this represents a serious citation integrity issue

2. **Review Required:** Check that all incomplete citations ([14], [33], [24], [37]) can be properly completed

3. **Quality Check:** Despite the few issues, the overall citation quality is excellent - this demonstrates strong research skills

4. **Commendation:** Student has done excellent work citing primarily Q1 journals and authoritative sources in the field

5. **Learning Opportunity:** Use this audit as a teaching moment about careful citation practices and verification

## Validation Notes

### Audit Methodology

This audit was conducted using:
- **Web Search:** Comprehensive searches across Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, publisher websites, and academic databases
- **Verification Standards:** Each reference checked against original sources where possible
- **Quality Assessment:** SJR rankings verified through SCImago Journal Rank database
- **Content Verification:** Abstracts and summaries checked for relevance to cited claims

### Limitations

1. **Abstract-Only Verification:** Most verifications based on abstracts and metadata rather than full-text review
2. **Paywall Limitations:** Some articles behind paywalls; verification limited to publicly available information
3. **Recent Publications:** Very recent publications (2023) may not yet have complete indexing
4. **Regional Journals:** Some non-US journals may be less well-indexed in major databases

### Confidence Levels

- **High Confidence:** 44/48 references (91.7%)
- **Medium Confidence:** 3/48 references (6.3%)
- **Failed Verification:** 1/48 references (2.1%)
