   - **Assessment**: Likely legitimate Iranian journal with limited international indexing
   - **Recommendation**: Acceptable; regional journal publication

**MAJOR Issue** (1 reference, 1.9%):

3. **Reference 39**: Nurettin Oner (2016) - Journal of Health Care Finance
   - **Issue**: **CANNOT VERIFY** through any database or source
   - **Assessment**: This is the ONLY reference that could not be verified
   - **Possible Explanations**:
     - Incorrect author name spelling (Nurettin vs. Nuretin, etc.)
     - Incorrect journal name or year
     - Non-indexed publication or conference proceeding
     - Potentially fabricated (though unlikely given quality of all other references)
   - **Recommendation**: **AUTHORS MUST VERIFY AND CORRECT THIS CITATION**
   - **Impact**: This single unverifiable reference does not materially affect the overall excellent citation quality, but should be corrected

### Regional Journal Considerations

Several Iranian journals (References 3, 33, 34, 35, 36) are not indexed in major international databases. This is **NOT a problem** because:
1. These are legitimate national/regional publications
2. They provide essential local context for Iran-focused study
3. Several are confirmed through subsequent citations in indexed journals
4. Regional journals are appropriate for local case studies

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Authors

1. **URGENT**: Verify and correct Reference 39 (Nurettin Oner, 2016)
   - Check original source document
   - Verify author name spelling
   - Confirm journal name and year
   - Consider removing if cannot be verified

2. **Minor Corrections**:
   - Reference 18: Confirm edition year (cited as 2010, but 11th edition appears to be 2013)
   - Reference 23: Update URL formatting for Commonwealth Fund article
   - Reference 42: Minor correction to author name (Fowler EJ)
   - Reference 43: Clarify URL for COVID Tracking Project/HHS data

3. **Enhancement Opportunities**:
   - Consider adding volume/issue numbers for references missing this information (e.g., Ref 50)
   - Ensure consistent URL formatting across all web-based references

### For Supervisors

This manuscript demonstrates **EXEMPLARY citation practices**:

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

**Overall Citation Quality Grade**: **A (Excellent)**
**Verification Success Rate**: 96.3% (52/54)
**Fabrication Risk**: **MINIMAL** (0 confirmed fabrications)
**Required Actions**: **MINOR** (1 reference correction required)

**Recommendation**: **APPROVE with minor revision**

This citation audit demonstrates exemplary academic integrity and research quality. The student has:
- Conducted thorough literature review across multiple countries and methodologies
- Selected high-quality, peer-reviewed sources (53.7% Q1 journals)
- Appropriately included grey literature and policy documents
