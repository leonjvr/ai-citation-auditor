## Verification Methodology

### Search Strategy

For each reference, the following systematic approach was used:

1. **Primary Search**: Google Scholar query with author names, year, and key title words
2. **Secondary Search**: Semantic Scholar API search (when available)
3. **Verification Points**:
   - Title match (exact or semantically identical)
   - Author list confirmation
   - Publication year
   - Journal/venue name
   - Volume and page numbers
   - DOI confirmation (when available)

### Evidence Quality

All verifications achieved **HIGH confidence** level based on:
- Multiple independent sources confirming publication details
- Official publisher websites accessed
- PubMed/PMC records located
- DOI resolution successful
- Abstract content confirming topic relevance

### Limitations

1. **Full-text access**: Not all papers were accessed in full text; verification based on abstracts and metadata
2. **Content accuracy**: Verification confirms existence and metadata but does not verify that cited content accurately represents source findings
3. **Orphan analysis**: In-text citation checking was not performed (would require access to full manuscript)
4. **SJR temporal accuracy**: SJR rankings checked for 2024; rankings at time of publication (2014) may have differed
