Published in the Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on NLP for COVID-19 at ACL 2020. Key findings: While most positive cases within Veterans Affairs (VA) are identified through structured laboratory results, some patients are tested or diagnosed outside VA so their clinical status is documented only in free-text narratives. This NLP process identified 6,360 positive cases without corresponding laboratory data, accounting for 36.1% of total confirmed positive cases in VA. System performance: 82.4% precision and 94.2% recall. A public-facing implementation is released as open source.

---

## 8. METHODOLOGY NOTES

### Verification Protocol Used

**Primary Search Tools:**
- Web search for each reference with multiple query strategies
- CrossRef DOI verification where applicable
- PubMed/PMC for biomedical literature
- ACL Anthology for computational linguistics papers
- Official journal websites for publication verification
- SCImago Journal Rank (SJR) database for quality metrics

**Verification Steps per Reference:**
1. Independent web search using authors, year, title, and journal
2. Confirmation of DOI (where provided)
3. Verification of publication details (volume, issue, pages)
4. Abstract/summary retrieval for content verification
5. SJR quality metric lookup for journal articles
6. Documentation of any discrepancies

**Quality Assurance:**
- Zero assumptions made about reference accuracy
- All references searched independently without relying on LLM training data
- Multiple verification sources used where possible
- Discrepancies documented explicitly
- "Cannot verify" approach used when search fails (none in this audit)

### Limitations of This Audit

1. **Abstract-Only Verification**: Content verification based on abstracts and titles only; full-text comparison with citation context in document body not performed
2. **Orphan Analysis Not Performed**: Assessment of whether references are cited in text requires access to full document body
3. **Citation Context Not Assessed**: Whether references are used appropriately in context requires full-text analysis
4. **SJR Temporal Variation**: SJR scores used are from 2024 data; scores at time of publication (2020-2021) may have differed
5. **Conference Ranking**: ACL workshop ranking not assessed (though ACL is recognized top-tier venue)

**Despite these limitations**, this audit provides strong evidence of **excellent citation quality and accuracy** in the reference list.
