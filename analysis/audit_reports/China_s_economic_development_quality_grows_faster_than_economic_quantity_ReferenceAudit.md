### [22] Shi, D., Li, P. (1998) - Measurement and international comparison

**Verification Status**: ❌ **CANNOT VERIFY**

**Citation Details**:
- **Authors**: Shi D, Li P
- **Title**: Measurement and international comparison of high quality economic development in China
- **Publication**: Southeast Academic Research, (5):169–180, 1998
- **Language**: Likely Chinese

**Search Attempts**:
- Multiple searches with author names, title keywords, and journal name
- No results in any international database
- Southeast Academic Research not found in indexed sources

**Why Verification Failed**: Chinese domestic journal from 1998, likely not digitized or indexed in international databases.

**Suspicious Elements**:
- ⚠️ The year 1998 seems very early for research on "high quality economic development" in China (this terminology became prominent in the 2010s)
- Title anachronistically uses modern framing ("high quality development") for 1998
- Journal name uncertain

**Accurate as Cited?**: **UNKNOWN - POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC**

**Potential Issues**:
- The phrase "high quality development" (高质量发展) became official policy terminology much later (Xi Jinping era, 2017+)
- A 1998 paper using this exact terminology would be ahead of its time
- May be mistaken reference or translation issue

**Quality Assessment**: Unknown (cannot locate)

**Confidence Level**: VERY LOW

## CRITICAL ISSUES SUMMARY

### 🔴 **Critical Issues (Must Address)**

1. **RETRACTED ARTICLE [15]**: Amjad et al. (2022) has been officially retracted and MUST be removed from the reference list immediately. This is a serious citation integrity violation.

2. **DATE ERROR [9]**: Wang, Lopez & Thomas cited as 2017 but published 2008. Correct the citation date.

3. **SUSPICIOUS 1998 REFERENCE [22]**: Shi & Li (1998) uses terminology ("high quality economic development") that anachronistically predates its widespread use. Authors should verify this reference's existence and accuracy.

### ⚠️ **Major Concerns (Should Address)**

4. **VERIFICATION BARRIER**: 36.4% of references (8/22) are in Chinese journals not accessible through international databases, making independent verification impossible for international reviewers.

5. **RELEVANCE ISSUES**: Multiple references ([13], [17], [18]) have questionable relevance to the paper's core topic (China's economic development quality measurement). Papers about:
   - Pharmaceutical employee HRM in Pakistan
   - COVID-19 social outcomes in Pakistan
   - COVID-19 and sustainable production (general)

   These do not clearly support claims about measuring China's economic quality vs quantity.

6. **CITATION CONCENTRATION**: 40.9% (9/22) of references come from a single research network (Abbass co-authored papers), with most focusing on Pakistan/South Asia rather than China.

### ℹ️ **Minor Issues (Consider Addressing)**

7. **Geographic Mismatch**: 22.7% of references focus specifically on Pakistan, yet paper is about China. While comparative/methodological relevance is possible, the concentration suggests potential padding.

8. **Limited Access to Primary Chinese Literature**: For a paper about China published in an international journal, the reliance on unverifiable Chinese sources creates reproducibility challenges for international readers.

## CONCLUSION

### Overall Assessment: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL PASS WITH MAJOR CONCERNS

**Summary**:
This reference list demonstrates a **mixed quality profile**. The successfully verified international publications are predominantly high-quality (Q1-Q2 journals with average SJR of 1.10), which is commendable. However, the audit identified one **critical citation integrity issue** (retracted article), one **date error**, and **questionable relevance** for several references.

### Key Strengths:
1. ✅ High-quality verified journals (mostly Q1-Q2)
2. ✅ Inclusion of seminal methodological paper (Huang et al., 1998)
3. ✅ Generally accurate bibliographic details for verified sources
4. ✅ Appropriate use of working papers (Barro, Wang et al.)

### Key Weaknesses:
1. ❌ **Retracted article cited** (Reference [15]) - UNACCEPTABLE
2. ❌ Publication date error (Reference [9])
3. ⚠️ Suspicious 1998 reference with anachronistic terminology (Reference [22])
4. ⚠️ 36.4% unverifiable Chinese sources (barrier to international reproducibility)
5. ⚠️ Questionable relevance of multiple references to paper's core topic
6. ⚠️ Over-concentration in single recent research network (40.9%)
7. ⚠️ Geographic mismatch (22.7% Pakistan-focused for China paper)

### Publication Readiness: ❌ **NOT READY - REVISIONS REQUIRED**

**Required actions before publication**:
1. **MUST** remove retracted reference [15]
2. **MUST** correct date for reference [9]
3. **SHOULD** verify reference [22] or remove
4. **SHOULD** justify relevance of references [13], [17], [18] or replace
5. **RECOMMENDED** to add access notes for Chinese references

### Academic Integrity Score: 6.5/10

**Deductions**:
- Critical Issue (Retracted article): -2.0
- Date Error: -0.5
- Unverifiable sources (36%): -0.5
- Relevance issues: -0.5

**Final Recommendation**:
The paper should **not be accepted for publication** without addressing the retracted article citation. Once critical issues are resolved, the reference list would be of **adequate quality** for publication, though authors should still consider strengthening relevance and reducing verification barriers for international readers.
