## STRICT VERIFICATION STANDARDS

### Zero Assumptions Policy
- **NEVER** assume a reference is correct without verification
- **NEVER** fill in missing information speculatively
- **NEVER** accept partial matches as verification
- **ALWAYS** document why verification failed or is incomplete

### When to Mark "CANNOT VERIFY"
Document explicitly when verification is impossible and state the specific reason:
- Source not found in any database → "Exhaustive search yielded no results"
- Ambiguous match → "Multiple similar papers found; cannot confirm which is cited"
- Incomplete reference → "Missing [elements]; insufficient information to locate"
- Access restricted → "Source identified but abstract not available"
- Language barrier → "Source in [language]; cannot verify content"
- Paywall → "Behind paywall; abstract available but full content unverified"
- Grey literature → "Not indexed; institutional repository link [status]"

### When to Mark "SUSPICIOUS"
- Pattern of issues: Multiple references from same author/year fail verification
- Unusual venues: Journal names not in any database
- Impossible combinations: Author + venue + year don't logically fit
- Predatory indicators: Signs of predatory publishing

### When to Mark "MISREPRESENTED"
- Content contradiction: Source argues opposite of citation
- Scope inflation: Narrow study cited as broad finding
- Method mischaracterization: Qualitative cited as quantitative
- Cherry-picking: One finding cited, contradictory findings ignored
- Context removal: Quote cited without critical context

## IMPORTANT NOTES

**Note 1**: This is a validation dataset audit. The purpose is to test the AI-Powered Citation Auditor methodology's accuracy and reliability.

**Note 2**: Document EVERY search attempt, EVERY verification result, and EVERY reason for failure. This data is critical for methodology validation.

**Note 3**: Do NOT skip any references. All {reference_count} references must be audited.

**Note 4**: Use actual API searches - do NOT rely on LLM training data knowledge. Fresh verification only.
