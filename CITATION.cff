abstract: >
  A rigorous, AI-powered methodology for conducting comprehensive
  reference and citation audits in academic manuscripts. This zero-assumption
  protocol employs Agentic Generative AI with access to Semantic Scholar,
  Google Scholar, and academic databases to systematically verify references,
  detect fabricated sources, identify citation errors, and assess journal
  quality. The methodology has been empirically tested across 6 academic
  documents (1,369 references) spanning honours projects to doctoral theses,
  achieving 76.8% average verification rate with 95%+ time efficiency
  compared to manual review.
