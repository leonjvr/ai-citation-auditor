## Using These Examples

### For Researchers
- **Understand methodology output** - See what comprehensive audits look like
- **Validate your own results** - Compare your audit outputs with these examples
- **Assess quality range** - Understand spectrum from excellent to critical
- **Benchmark performance** - Use as reference points for your corpus

### For Educators/Supervisors
- **Set expectations** - Show students what quality audits reveal
- **Training materials** - Use as case studies in academic integrity workshops
- **Quality benchmarks** - Establish standards for acceptable citation practices
- **Feedback examples** - Model how to provide constructive citation feedback

### For Students
- **Self-assessment** - Compare your work against quality examples
- **Learning tool** - Understand what constitutes good vs. poor citation practices
- **Error patterns** - Recognize common mistakes to avoid
- **Quality standards** - Internalize expectations for academic citation

## Statistics Summary

| Document | Type | Refs | Verification | Orphan Refs | Orphan Cites | Quality |
|----------|------|------|--------------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| **Excellent** | PhD Thesis | 916 | 100% (sample) | Minimal | 0 | üü¢ Q1-heavy |
| **High Quality** | Paper | 65 | 93% | 77% | 7% | üü¢ Q1-heavy |
| **Critical** | MCom | 196 | 35% | 83% | 46% | üî¥ Mixed/Unverifiable |

**Key Insight**: The methodology effectively stratifies document quality, from publication-ready (Excellent) to requiring complete rewrite (Critical).

## Ethical Considerations

### Why Anonymization Matters
- Protects student privacy and dignity
- Allows sharing of findings without stigma
- Focuses on methodology, not individual judgment
- Enables reproducibility without compromising confidentiality

### What Was Anonymized
- **Student names** ‚Üí "Student A", "Author"
- **Supervisor names** ‚Üí Removed entirely
- **Institution** ‚Üí Removed or generalized
- **Document titles** ‚Üí Generic titles (e.g., "MCom Strategic Management")
- **Specific research topics** ‚Üí Retained only for context
- **Personal identifiers** ‚Üí Stripped from all text

### Original Purpose
These audits were conducted as formative feedback for students, not as punitive measures. The goal is quality improvement and learning, not exposure of errors.

## Interpreting Audit Results

### Verification Success Rate
- **95-100%**: Excellent - minimal issues
- **85-95%**: Good - minor corrections needed
- **70-85%**: Acceptable - moderate revision required
- **50-70%**: Problematic - substantial revision needed
- **<50%**: Critical - major rewrite required

### Orphan Reference Rate
- **<5%**: Excellent management
- **5-15%**: Acceptable (some uncited background reading)
- **15-30%**: Concerning (possible padding)
- **30-50%**: Problematic (clear padding or poor integration)
- **>50%**: Critical (severe quality control failure)

### Critical Issues
- **0 unverifiable**: Clean audit
- **1-2 unverifiable**: Investigate but likely acceptable
- **3-5 unverifiable**: Concerning pattern
- **5+ unverifiable**: Serious integrity concerns requiring investigation

## Replication Notes

These examples are provided to support methodology replication. When conducting your own audits:

1. **Follow the protocol strictly** - See `protocol/CLAUDE.md`
2. **Document all search attempts** - Transparency is key
3. **Use zero-assumption approach** - Never guess or assume
4. **Validate with human review** - AI is a screening tool, not final arbiter
5. **Maintain anonymity** - If sharing results, protect identities

## Additional Resources

- **Protocol**: See `/protocol/CLAUDE.md` for complete methodology
- **Replication Guide**: See `/METHODOLOGY.md` for step-by-step instructions
- **Citation**: See `/CITATION.md` for how to cite this work

## Contributions

Have you conducted audits using this methodology? Consider contributing anonymized examples:

1. Anonymize thoroughly (remove ALL identifiable information)
2. Verify anonymization with a colleague
3. Submit via pull request with description
4. Include consent if original author approves sharing

**Guidelines for submissions**:
- Must be fully anonymized
- Must follow the standard audit report format
- Should represent interesting cases (not duplicative)
- Include brief context (document type, field, size)

---

**Note**: These examples represent a snapshot of methodology performance as of October 2025. As the protocol evolves, newer examples may be added. Always refer to the latest protocol version in `/protocol/CLAUDE.md`.

**Privacy Commitment**: No original student documents or personally identifiable audit reports are ever committed to this public repository. Only anonymized, educational examples are shared.
