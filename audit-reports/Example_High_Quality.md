### ORPHAN CITATIONS (Cited in Text but NOT in Reference List)

| Citation in Text | Location | Issue | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NONE IDENTIFIED** | N/A | The one extraction anomaly with special characters (Burgelman, 1984; Åmo & Kolvereid, 2018) was correctly matched to reference list upon manual review. | No action required. All in-text citations properly listed in references. |

**NOTE:** Initial extraction identified "(Burgelman, 1984; Åmo & Kolvereid, 2018)" with special character encoding issue (�mo), but manual verification confirms both references exist in list. This was a text extraction artifact, not a missing reference.

- Preserved special characters (Scandinavian characters like Å, ø)

**Phase 2: Citation Extraction**
- Regex-based extraction of in-text citations: `\(Author(?:\s+et al\.|\s+&\s+Author)*,?\s+\d{4}[a-z]?\)`
- Identified 16 citation instances
- Deduplicated to 15 unique author-year combinations

**Phase 3: Reference Parsing**
- Extracted 65 references from reference list section
- Parsed author names, years, titles, and publication venues
- Identified 64 successfully parsed (1 formatting anomaly)

**Phase 4: Citation-Reference Matching**
- Fuzzy matching of author surnames and years
- Matched 14 of 15 citations to reference list entries (93.3% match rate)
- Identified 1 orphan citation, 50 orphan references, 1 duplicate

**Phase 5: Web Verification**

## SPECIFIC ERRORS AND CORRECTIONS REQUIRED

### ERROR 1: Journal Name Incorrect

**Reference:** Campbell, D. J. (2000). The proactive employee: Managing workplace initiative. Academy of Management Perspectives, 14(3), 52–66.

**Error:** Journal name is INCORRECT. Article was published in "Academy of Management Executive" NOT "Academy of Management Perspectives."

**Explanation:** Academy of Management Executive was renamed to Academy of Management Perspectives in 2006. The 2000 article predates the name change.

**Correction Required:**
```
Campbell, D. J. (2000). The proactive employee: Managing workplace initiative.
Academy of Management Executive, 14(3), 52–66.
```

**Severity:** MODERATE - Technically incorrect but same journal (pre-rename). Should be corrected for accuracy.

---

### ERROR 2: Duplicate Reference

**References (Lines 168-169):**
- Hornsby, J. S., Kuratko, D. F., & Zahra, S. A. (2002). Middle managers' perception of the internal environment for corporate entrepreneurship: assessing a measurement scale. Journal of Business Venturing, 17(3), 253-273.
- Hornsby, J.S., Kuratko, D.F., & Zahra, S.A. (2002). Middle managers' perception of the internal environment for corporate entrepreneurship: assessing a measurement scale. Journal of Business Venturing, 17(3), 253-273.

**Error:** EXACT DUPLICATE - Same reference listed twice (minor formatting difference in author initials: "J. S." vs "J.S." - spacing difference only)

**Correction Required:** Remove one instance of the duplicate reference.

**Severity:** MINOR - Does not affect content accuracy but violates reference list formatting standards.

---

### ERROR 3: Page Number Formatting Error

**Reference:** Åmo, B.W., & Kolvereid, L. (2018). Corporate entrepreneurship. The SAGE Handbook of Small Business and Entrepreneurship. New York: Routledge, 289-278.

**Error:** Page numbers "289-278" are in REVERSE order (should be ascending order, e.g., "278-289" or "289-300").

**Correction Required:** Verify actual page numbers from source and correct to ascending order format.

**Severity:** MINOR - Appears to be typo. Chapter exists and authors verified. Page numbers need correction.

---

### ERROR 4: High Orphan Reference Rate

**Issue:** 50 out of 65 references (76.9%) are not cited in the text.

**Concern:** While not technically an "error," this is highly unusual and suggests:
1. Incomplete manuscript (references gathered but not yet cited), OR
2. Over-collection of references, OR
3. References may be cited in sections not captured in extraction (tables, figures, technical appendices)

**Recommendation:**
- Review each orphan reference for potential integration into literature review sections
- If not used, remove from reference list per academic standards
- If in tables/appendices, add note: "See Table X for additional references"

**Severity:** MODERATE - Does not affect cited references' accuracy but significantly inflates reference count.
