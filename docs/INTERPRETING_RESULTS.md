## Understanding the Audit Report Structure

Each audit report contains these sections in order:

### 1. Document Metadata
```markdown
**Document**: [Document Name]
**Audit Date**: 2025-10-17
**Total References**: 196
**Total Citations**: 103
**Citation Style**: APA 7th Edition
```

**What this tells you:**
- Basic document information
- Scale of the bibliography
- Whether citations and references are balanced

**Red flags:**
- Citations >> References (missing reference list entries)
- References >> Citations (orphan references, possible padding)

---

### 2. Executive Summary

```markdown

```

**Interpretation:**

| Metric | Meaning | Benchmark |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Verification Rate** | % of references successfully verified | >90% = Excellent, <50% = Critical |
| **Critical Issues** | Unverifiable refs, fabrications, mismatches | 0-2 = Normal, >5 = Concerning |

---

### 3. Detailed Verification Table

```markdown
| Reference | Evidence from Google Scholar/Semantic Scholar | Accurate as cited? | Notes | Citation Status | Reference Quality (SJR) |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Teece et al. (1997) | Dynamic capabilities and strategic management... | ‚úÖ Yes | Highly cited foundational work | ‚úÖ Cited in text (p. 12) | Q1 (SJR: 8.6) |
| Perry Piscione (2025) | ‚ùå No results found in any database | ‚ùå Cannot verify | Potential fabrication - SSRN ID not found | ‚ö†Ô∏è Cited in text (p. 45) | Unknown |
```

**How to read each column:**

#### Reference
- Short form citation (Author, Year)
- Use to cross-reference with main document

#### Evidence
- Summary of what was found in academic databases
- Confirms the source exists and what it's about
- Look for: Match with your understanding of the source

#### Accurate as cited?
- ‚úÖ Yes = Content matches how it's used in your document
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial = Source exists but minor discrepancies
- ‚ùå No = Content doesn't match or source not found

#### Notes
- Specific issues identified
- Explanations for verification failures
- Quality observations

#### Citation Status
- ‚úÖ Cited in text = Properly integrated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Orphan reference = Listed but never cited
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Orphan citation = Cited but not in reference list
- ‚ùå Mismatch = Citation doesn't match reference

#### Reference Quality (SJR)
- Q1 = Top 25% of journals in field (best)
- Q2 = 25-50th percentile
- Q3 = 50-75th percentile
- Q4 = Bottom 25% of journals
- N/A = Books, reports, not indexed

---

### 4. Orphan Analysis

```markdown
## Orphan References (listed but not cited)
**Count**: 163 out of 196 (83%)

Examples:
1. Porter, M. E. (1985). Competitive advantage...
2. Wernerfelt, B. (1984). A resource-based view...
[...]
```

**What this means:**

| Orphan Rate | Interpretation | Action Needed |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **0-5%** | Normal - background reading | Acceptable as-is |
| **5-15%** | Some uncited sources | Consider citing or removing |
| **15-30%** | Concerning - possible padding | Review necessity of each |
| **30-50%** | Problematic | Remove or integrate most |
| **>50%** | Critical quality failure | Complete rewrite needed |

**Possible explanations:**
- Student read sources but didn't cite them (cite them!)
- Student padded bibliography to meet length requirements (remove them!)
- Student used reference management software incorrectly (clean it up!)

---

### 5. Quality Distribution

```markdown
## Journal Quality Distribution

| Quartile | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Q1 | 32 | 70% |
| Q2 | 8 | 17% |
| Q3 | 3 | 7% |
| Q4 | 1 | 2% |
| Not indexed | 2 | 4% |
```

**Interpretation:**

**Excellent Quality** (PhD/Top-tier publication):
- 60%+ Q1 journals
- <10% Q3/Q4 journals
- Mix of foundational classics and recent publications

**Good Quality** (Master's thesis/Journal article):
- 40-60% Q1 journals
- 20-30% Q2 journals
- <20% Q3/Q4 journals

**Acceptable** (Honours/Course paper):
- 20-40% Q1 journals
- Mix of Q1-Q3 acceptable
- Some non-indexed sources OK if appropriate

**Problematic**:
- <20% Q1 journals
- Majority Q3/Q4 or non-indexed

## Executive Summary Metrics

### Verification Success Rate

```
Verified references / Total references √ó 100%
```

**Quality benchmarks:**

| Rate | Interpretation | Typical Action |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **95-100%** | Exceptional quality | Accept with minor formatting fixes |
| **85-95%** | High quality | Minor revisions (5-10 hours) |
| **70-85%** | Acceptable | Moderate revision (10-20 hours) |
| **50-70%** | Problematic | Substantial revision (20-40 hours) |
| **<50%** | Critical failure | Complete rewrite (40-60+ hours) |

**Factors affecting rate:**
- Document type (PhD expected higher than Honours)
- Field (STEM vs. humanities - different database coverage)
- Recency (2024-2025 publications harder to verify)
- Source types (grey literature reduces rate)

---

### Citation-Reference Balance

```
Citation count vs. Reference count
```

**Healthy patterns:**

**Research paper/thesis:**
- References ‚âà Citations (most sources cited once)
- OK if References > Citations by 10-20% (background reading)

**Literature review:**
- Citations > References (sources cited multiple times)
- Normal pattern for review articles

**Red flags:**

**References >> Citations:**
- 50% more references than citations = Concerning
- 2√ó more references = Bibliography padding
- **Example**: 200 references, 100 citations = Problem

**Citations >> References:**
- More citations than references = Missing reference entries
- **Example**: 100 citations, 80 references = 20 missing entries

---

## Verification Status Codes

### ‚úÖ VERIFIED
```
Evidence: Found in Semantic Scholar. "Dynamic capabilities and strategic
management." Strategic Management Journal, 18(7), 509-533.
Accurate as cited?: ‚úÖ Yes
```

**Meaning:** Reference successfully confirmed in academic databases with matching metadata (title, authors, year, venue).

**Confidence level:** High - can proceed with confidence

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è VERIFIED WITH DISCREPANCIES
```
Evidence: Found in Google Scholar. Year is 2007, not 2010 as cited.
Accurate as cited?: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial - Year error
```

**Meaning:** Source exists but has minor errors in citation.

**Action required:** Correct the discrepancy (update year, author name, journal, etc.)

---

### ‚ùå UNVERIFIABLE - Exhaustive search yielded no results
```
Evidence: Searched Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar, CrossRef. No results found.
Accurate as cited?: ‚ùå Cannot verify
Notes: Potential fabrication
```

**Meaning:** Source cannot be located in any major academic database.

**Possible reasons:**
1. **Fabricated** - completely made up (most serious)
2. **Not yet published** - accepted but not yet online
3. **Grey literature** - institutional report, thesis, not indexed
4. **Paywalled** - exists but not visible to public search
5. **Error in citation** - so incorrect that search fails

**Action required:**
1. Request original PDF from student
2. Verify existence through other means (author website, institution)
3. If cannot verify ‚Üí remove or replace

---

### ‚ùå UNVERIFIABLE - Multiple ambiguous matches found
```
Evidence: Found 5 different papers with similar titles by different authors.
Accurate as cited?: ‚ùå Cannot determine which is correct
Notes: Insufficient information to verify
```

**Meaning:** Citation information too vague to identify specific source.

**Action required:** Student must provide complete reference details (full title, all authors, volume/issue, DOI).

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è FOUND BUT RETRACTED
```
Evidence: Found in Semantic Scholar. RETRACTED 2023 for data fabrication.
Accurate as cited?: ‚ùå No - Retracted publication
Notes: Must be removed immediately
```

**Meaning:** Source exists but has been retracted from literature.

**Action required:** Remove reference and find alternative source.

---

## Journal Quality Ratings

- **Expected:** 40-70% of references in strong academic work

**Q2 (Second Quartile) - SJR 0.5-1.0**
- 25th-50th percentile
- Solid academic journals, good peer review
- **Interpretation:** Acceptable quality, credible sources
- **Expected:** 20-40% of references

**Q3 (Third Quartile) - SJR 0.2-0.5**
- 50th-75th percentile
- Emerging or specialized journals

- Books from academic publishers = Good
- Grey literature, websites = Use sparingly

---

## Citation Status Categories

### ‚úÖ Cited in text (p. 12)
**Meaning:** Reference properly integrated into the document.

**Example:**
> Reference list: Barney, J. B. (1991). Firm resources...
> In-text: "...as proposed by the resource-based view (Barney, 1991)..."

**Status:** ‚úÖ Good - no action needed

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Orphan reference - listed but not cited
**Meaning:** Appears in reference list but never mentioned in document.

**Example:**
> Reference list: Porter, M. E. (1985). Competitive advantage...
> In-text: [No mention of Porter 1985 anywhere]

**Action required:**
1. **If relevant:** Add citation to appropriate section
2. **If not relevant:** Remove from reference list
3. **If background reading:** Cite in introduction/literature review

**Red flag:** >30% orphan references suggests padding

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Orphan citation - cited but not listed
**Meaning:** Cited in text but no reference list entry.

**Example:**
> In-text: "...as shown by Wernerfelt (1984)..."
> Reference list: [No Wernerfelt 1984 entry]

**Action required:** Add complete reference to reference list

**Common cause:** Reference management software error

---

### ‚ùå Citation-reference mismatch
**Meaning:** Information in citation doesn't match reference list.

**Example:**
> In-text: "...following Chen et al. (2010)..."
> Reference list: Chen, M. J., Su, K. H., & Tsai, W. (2007)...

**Action required:** Correct either the in-text citation or reference list entry to match.

## Common Patterns and What They Mean

### Pattern 1: High orphan reference rate (>50%)

**What it suggests:**
- Bibliography padding to meet length requirements
- Student read sources but didn't integrate them
- Copy-paste from reference management software without curation

**Actions:**
- Review each orphan reference for relevance
- If relevant ‚Üí cite in text
- If not relevant ‚Üí remove
- If >80% orphans ‚Üí likely needs complete rewrite

---

### Pattern 2: Cluster of unverifiable 2024-2025 references

**What it suggests:**
- Student citing very recent publications not yet indexed
- Potential fabrication (if >5 from same year)
- Pre-prints or working papers

**Actions:**
- Request original PDFs
- Check author websites, institutional repositories
- Verify pre-prints have been published
- If cannot verify ‚Üí replace with established sources

---

### Pattern 3: Many citation-reference year mismatches

**What it suggests:**
- Manual entry errors
- Reference management software issues
- Student citing from memory, not from original source

**Actions:**
- Correct all year mismatches
- Verify student has original sources
- Train on proper citation practices

---

### Pattern 4: Mix of very old (>20 years) and very new (<2 years) with nothing in between

**What it suggests:**
- Incomplete literature review
- Missing recent developments in field
- Over-reliance on foundational works

**Actions:**
- Add sources from past 5-10 years
- Demonstrate evolution of field
- Balance classic and contemporary sources

---

### Pattern 5: Heavy use of non-peer-reviewed sources (websites, blogs, LinkedIn)

**What it suggests:**
- Insufficient academic literature search
- Misunderstanding of source quality expectations
- Practitioner-focused rather than research-focused

**Actions:**
- Replace with peer-reviewed alternatives
- Use websites only for data, not theory
- Improve database search skills

---

### Pattern 6: Duplicate references with slight variations

**What it suggests:**
- Reference management software imported same source multiple times
- Student didn't notice duplicates

**Actions:**
- Merge duplicate entries
- Keep version with most complete information
- Update all in-text citations to reference single entry

---

## Using Audit Results for Learning

### For Students

**Green/Yellow flags (minor issues):**
- Review errors to understand citation accuracy requirements
- Learn from mistakes (year errors, journal names, author names)
- Improve reference management practices

**Red flags (major issues):**
- Reassess research strategy
- Seek training on literature searches
- Learn to use reference management software
- Understand difference between peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed sources

---

### For Supervisors

**Use audit results to:**
- Identify students needing additional support
- Provide objective, evidence-based feedback
- Set clear quality benchmarks
- Track improvement over multiple drafts
- Demonstrate importance of citation accuracy

**Feedback approach:**
- Frame as quality improvement, not punishment
- Focus on learning from errors
- Provide resources (reference management training, database tutorials)
- Set realistic timelines for revision based on severity

---

## Questions to Ask When Interpreting Results

1. **Is the verification rate appropriate for this document type?**
   - PhD/Journal article: Expect 85-95%+
   - Master's: Expect 70-85%
   - Honours: Expect 60-75%

2. **Are unverifiable references truly fabricated or just hard to find?**
   - Check manually before accusing fabrication
   - Provide opportunity for student to provide evidence

3. **Is the orphan rate acceptable given the document type?**
   - Literature review: Higher acceptable
   - Empirical study: Should be low (<10%)

4. **Does journal quality match expectations for this level?**
   - PhD: 60%+ Q1
   - Master's: 40%+ Q1
   - Honours: 20%+ Q1

5. **Are errors systematic (suggesting lack of knowledge) or random (suggesting carelessness)?**
   - Systematic ‚Üí training needed
   - Random ‚Üí more careful proofreading needed
